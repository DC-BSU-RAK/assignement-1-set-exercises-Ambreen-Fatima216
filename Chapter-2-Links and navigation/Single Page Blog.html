        <h2>Unforgettable Character Arcs</h2>
        <p class="highlight">TWD wasn’t about the zombies. It was about the people, their choices, and the pain of survival.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rick Grimes:</strong> From a small-town sheriff's deputy to a hardened leader of survivors, Rick was the heart of the group. He tried to keep everyone safe, even when the world crumbled around him. His journey was painful, and by the time he said "We are the walking dead," we knew he had lost parts of himself to the world he was trying to survive in.</li>
            <li><strong>Daryl Dixon:</strong> At first, he was just Merle’s angry little brother, someone no one really trusted. But over time, Daryl became the most dependable person in the group. Quiet, loyal, and fearless, he proved again and again that he had the group's back. His crossbow and bike became as iconic as the man himself.</li>           
            <li><strong>Negan:</strong> He came in like a nightmare, swinging his bat Lucille and changing everything. At first, he was the villain everyone feared. But over time, layers of guilt, loss, and redemption started to show. By the end, Negan became one of the most complicated and strangely relatable characters in the series.</li>
            <li><strong>Carl Grimes:</strong> We saw Carl grow up right in front of us—from a curious kid to someone forced to make adult decisions way too early. He faced loss after loss, but still held onto hope. His death was one of the most emotional parts of the series and left a mark on everyone who followed his story.</li>
            <li><strong>Glenn Rhee:</strong> Glenn started out as the quick-witted pizza delivery guy who always volunteered for risky missions. Over time, he grew into a true hero—brave, kind, and always willing to do the right thing. His death hit fans hard and reminded us just how brutal this world had become.</li>

        <h2>What People Said</h2>
        <ul class="fan-reviews">
            <li><strong>"The Walking Dead changed the game for me."</strong><br>
                It’s more than zombies — it’s about people, loyalty, and survival. Rick’s journey from peacekeeper to hardened leader still gives me chills. Terminus was one of the darkest, most intense arcs ever.</li>             
            <li><strong>"Negan was never the real villain."</strong><br>
                Sure, he did awful things, but he was just using fear to lead — like Rick did later. If things were different, they might’ve been allies. The show constantly made us question who the real threat was.</li>
            <li> <strong>"I didn’t expect to love the show after Rick left, but Season 9 proved me wrong."</strong><br>
                Carol and Daryl carried it. Their bond was everything. And Judith? A tiny legend in the making.</li>
            <li><strong>"Theory: Rick’s still alive and part of something bigger."</strong><br>
              He didn’t die — he vanished. I think the CRM has him, and they’re saving his return for something massive. The story isn’t over.</li>
            <li><strong>"I’d watch all 11 seasons again without hesitation."</strong><br>
              These characters felt real. Glenn and Maggie’s love, the losses, the growth — it all hit hard. The finale broke me but also gave hope. That’s what made it special.</li>
          </ul>

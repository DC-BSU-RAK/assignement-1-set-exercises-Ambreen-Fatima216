<ul>
  <li><strong>Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln)</strong> – A former sheriff's deputy who wakes up in a hospital to find the world overtaken by the undead. Rick evolves from a hopeful protector to a hardened leader willing to make brutal choices to keep his people alive. His leadership is marked by tragedy, sacrifice, and the constant struggle to hold onto his humanity. </li>
  <li><strong>Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus)</strong> – Once a lone wolf with a troubled past, Daryl becomes the moral compass of the group.
